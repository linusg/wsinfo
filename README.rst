The wsinfo library
==================

wsinfo (short for website information) is a Python package for getting some
useful information about some website, without the need to write some
complicated hackish Python code.

Requirements
------------

The package is compatible with both Python 2 and 3, so everything you need is
a recent Python installation.

Installation
------------

The wsinfo library is available on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/wsinfo>`_,
so you can install it using ``pip``::

    pip install wsinfo

Usage
-----

The usage of the wsinfo library is as easy as::

    >>> import wsinfo
    >>> w = wsinfo.Info("https://github.com")
    >>> w.ip
    '192.30.253.112'
    >>> w.http_status_code
    200
    >>> w.title
    'How people build software Â· GitHub'
    >>> w.content
    '<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n[...]\n</html>'

Tested Platforms and Python Versions

The code was tested with the following software configurations:

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, CPython 2.7.12
